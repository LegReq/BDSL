---

Bread'n'Butter is an open-source project aimed at simplifying and streamlining
the process of software design using a technique known as **breadboarding**.

Inspired by the concepts presented in Basecamp's "Shape Up," this project
provides tools to create, visualize, and share breadboards in a software
development context. Our goal is to enhance collaboration and clarity in the
early stages of software design, where functional relationships and user
interactions are key focal points.

At its core, Bread'n'Butter offers a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for
defining breadboards, a parser to translate this DSL into various formats, and
an interactive GUI for a visual exploration of designs.

Whether you're a developer, a designer, or someone interested in software
project planning, Bread'n'Butter is designed to be accessible, user-friendly,
and a valuable addition to your toolkit.
