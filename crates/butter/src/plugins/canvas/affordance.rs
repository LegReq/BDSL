//! Affordance Plugin: Facilitating Affordance Entities Within Places
//!
//! Concentrates on the lifecycle and arrangement of *affordances*â€”interactive or descriptive
//! elements associated with places within a breadboard. The [`AffordancePlugin`] operates by
//! responding to the creation of places and the establishment of affordances, orchestrating their
//! proper positioning and integration within the visual structure of the canvas.
//!
//! For detailed information on individual parts of this plugin, please refer to the respective
//! documentation within this module.
